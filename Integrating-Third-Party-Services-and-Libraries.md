```python
import requests
import json

def call_api(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an HTTPError for bad responses (4xx and 5xx)
        data = response.json()  # Parse JSON response
        return data
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
        return f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}"
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        return f"Error occurred: {err}"
    except json.JSONDecodeError as json_err:
        return f"JSON decode error: {json_err}"

# Example usage
url = "https://api.example.com/data"
result = call_api(url)
print(result)
```

def fetch_weather_data(city_name, api_key):
    """
    Fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API for a given city.

    Parameters:
    city_name (str): Name of the city to fetch weather for.
    api_key (str): API key for authenticating with OpenWeatherMap API.

    Returns:
    dict: Parsed JSON data containing weather information.
    """
    base_url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
    params = {
        'q': city_name,
        'appid': api_key,
        'units': 'metric'  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit
    }
    
    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        response.raise_for_status()

# Example usage:
# api_key = "your_api_key_here"
# city_name = "London"
# weather_data = fetch_weather_data(city_name, api_key)
# print(weather_data)
```

## Helping Import and Use Third-Party Libraries Effectively

Third-party libraries can significantly enhance your application's functionality, but integrating them correctly requires understanding their APIs and usage patterns. Copilot assists by:

1. **Import Statements**: Automatically suggesting and completing import statements based on the functions and classes you use in your code.
2. **Documentation Snippets**: Providing quick access to documentation snippets or examples based on the library you’re using.
3. **Function Implementations**: Suggesting how to use specific functions or methods from the library, including necessary parameters and expected outputs.

### Example: Using a Third-Party Library in JavaScript

Let’s consider integrating **Lodash**, a popular utility library, into a JavaScript project.

### Prompt:
```markdown
Generate a function using Lodash to remove duplicates from an array in JavaScript
```

<details>
<summary><strong>View Response</strong></summary>
<blockquote>

```javascript
// Ensure Lodash is included in your project
const _ = require('lodash');

function removeDuplicates(array) {
    /**
     * Remove duplicates from an array using Lodash.
     *
     * Parameters:
     * array (Array): The array to remove duplicates from.
     *
     * Returns:
     * Array: A new array with duplicates removed.
     */
    return _.uniq(array);
}

// Example usage:
const array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
const uniqueArray = removeDuplicates(array);
console.log(uniqueArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
</blockquote>
</details>

This function uses Lodash's uniq method to remove duplicate values from the input array and returns a new array with only unique values.

        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching weather data: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    city = "London"
    weather_data = fetch_weather_data(city)
    if weather_data:
        print(weather_data)
```
